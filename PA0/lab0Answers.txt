The difference between the stack top before and after entering the printtos function is 76 in decimal.
When the printtos function in called from its parent functin (main in this case), the OS starts saving the important information onto tht stack. The information
includes the parameters of the called function (printtos) in this case followed by the return address of the calling function i.e. main. The return address is used to 
switch the control back to the main function function when the printtos function finishes executing. After this, the OS saves the base pointer to the stack as well which 
gives a temporary base end for the current process in execution. After saving the base pointer, the OS starts saving the local valriables of the called function i.e. printtos()
which can be accessed using the stack pointer. The stack pointer here denotes the top of the stack at any point of time.

Answer 3) 

If we simply check the difference between the stack top before and after entering printtos() function, it gives a difference of 76 in decimal. However, I have only decalred 5 variables 
(4 long and 1 int) which simply converts to 36 in decimal. Also, the memory locations directly above the EBP stores the local variables. This implies that the OS is storing some other
values after pushing the local variables onto the satck. Therefore, printing the top 4 memory locations doesn't give the stored local variable's values.
After disabling the compiler optimization, I still could not see the local variables. However, I can see that the difference changes from 76 to 40. This shows that 
the compiler now is storing less number of varaibles but still the local variables could not be displayed since they are still stored on 4 memory locations above the EBP.
